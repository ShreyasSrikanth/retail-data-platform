# Data Product Blueprint

> Copy this file to `docs/blueprint.md` (or `classes/class00-blueprint.md` for
> the bootcamp) and fill it in **with** the stakeholders, not for them. Sections are
> numbered in the order they are usually discovered, not the order they are finished.

## How to use this template

**You will not have everything at the start.** Every section carries a *gate*:

| Gate | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 🟥 **Must have before implementation starts** | Without it you cannot write a single correct line: source system details, access, ownership, the business scenario, confidentiality. |
| 🟧 **Must have before Silver/Gold design** | You can land raw data without it, but you cannot model: business definitions, KPIs, refresh/latency, quality rules, target design. |
| 🟩 **Can be completed during / after build** | Consumption details, physical tuning, orchestration specifics, dictionary, lineage, runbook. Filled as decisions are made; kept in sync afterwards. |

Rules:

1. Every section has an **owner** (a person, not a team) and a **status**: `unknown`, `draft`, `agreed`, `changed on <date>`.
2. Write "unknown" rather than guessing. An explicit unknown is a task; a guess is a future incident.
3. When a section changes after implementation started, record it in the **Change log** (§22) and update the traceability table (§21).
4. Profile the data before signing off §5, §9 and §10 — real data overrules what anyone tells you.

Owner: ______ · Status: ______

* Deployment identity (dev: user; prod: service principal) and the privileges it needs.
* Where secrets live; naming convention; rotation policy; what to do about credentials ever exposed.

Owner (steward): ______ · Status: ______

| Dataset / column | Classification (public / internal / confidential / PII / special category) | Handling rule | Retention |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Plus reconciliation acceptance criteria (source → warehouse → report totals) and the
**known caveats accepted by the business** (documented, not hidden).

## 10. Conceptual model 🟧

Owner: ______ · Status: ______

Business entities and relationships in words and one diagram (customer *places* order,
order *contains* product, sale *happens at* store…). No columns, no keys. This is what
you validate with the business.

## 11. Logical model 🟧

Owner: ______ · Status: ______
